This is the repo for the public-facing DC chapter of Women Who Code. Edits to website should be made with feature branches. Other branches are as follows:

```master```: Branch kept in sync across members for changes others should have locally but aren't ready to go live yet.

```production```: Branch that has a webhook for Heroku. Don't automatically push to production, submit a pull request. Pushes to production should probably receive two :+1:s before getting submitted.
